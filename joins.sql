Why is outer join useful?
It is useful for tallying the many side of a one-to-many or a many-to-many association using aggregation.

This query counts how many tweets each author has posted, and also how many total characters each author has authored.

Tweet count is either a 1 or a 0, because each row can represent an individual tweet - although the tweet could also be absent in the case that that user has never posted a tweet. So we use the case statement:

case when tweet.id is NULL then 0 else 1 end

to return a 0 if there isn't a tweet and 1 if there is.

character_count is the character length of the tweet and we got that by calling the char_length() function. Once we have this query, we can apply the sum() function to aggregate the character_count and the tweet_count in combination with group by author.id, and that's how we got the previous SQL statement.
